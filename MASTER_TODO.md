# MASTER TODO — Authoritative Engineering Backlog

**Created:** 2026-07-15 (Cycle 70) · **Owner default:** unassigned (single-maintainer repo; "owner" marks who verified, not who must do it)
**Rules (from `MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`):** never delete completed tasks — mark them VERIFIED with evidence and date. Every status claim below is backed by a command run or file:line read; nothing is inferred from filenames or prior reports. Companion evidence documents: `SCORECARD.md` (cycle log + gauges), `docs/MONDAY_AI_RAG_READINESS_REPORT.md` (defect register D1–D11).

**Statuses:** `VERIFIED` (done + evidence) · `PARTIAL` (real progress, scoped remainder) · `OPEN` · `BLOCKED` (with evidence) · `DEFERRED` (with justification) · `N/A` (with justification).

## 12. Process guards (standing, every cycle)

- Re-verify `tsc`/`eslint`/suites before every push — parallel sessions land work between cycles (Cy69 caught 10 tsc errors this way).
- Grep `SCORECARD.md` for the highest cycle number before claiming the next — the sequence is shared across sessions.
- Watch for cp1252 mojibake (`â€"`) whenever SCORECARD.md is rewritten by other tooling (recurred once, D11).
- Migration replays: use `SQLITE_PATH` env var, never `DATABASE_NAME`, and always a scratch file.
- Performance numbers only against a curl-verified isolated `vite preview` — never a reused port.
