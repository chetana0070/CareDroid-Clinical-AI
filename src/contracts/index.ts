/**
 * CareDroid Canonical Contracts
 *
 * This module re-exports the canonical domain types and provides
 * compatibility bridges with legacy type definitions.
 *
 * Migration strategy:
 * - New code should import from '@/contracts' or '@/contracts/domains'
 * - Legacy code continues to import from '@/types/emergency'
 * - Over time, migrate imports to use these canonical types
 */

// Re-export all canonical types
export * from './domains';
export * from './results';
export * from './accountableAi';

// Re-export commonly used legacy types for backward compatibility
