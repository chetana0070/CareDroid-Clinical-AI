# Orphan Detection Report

Generated: 2026-07-23 (regenerate with `npm run orphan-detection:write-docs`)

## Classification key

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **wire** | Reachable in product intent (nav/inventory) but missing route, import, or API contract |
| **merge** | Duplicate surface or overlapping module — consolidate |
| **quarantine** | No production consumer — archive or delete after review |
| **legacy** | Redirect, alias, gated stub, or deprecated path kept for compatibility |

## Executive summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Total orphan findings | 570 |
| App.jsx routes | 152 |
| Orphan / gap routes | 221 |
| Orphan pages | 150 |
| Orphan components | 7 |
| Domain module findings (dashboard / simulation / lab / 3D) | 20 |
| Orphan services | 11 |
| Executor contract gaps | 0 |
| API orphans / stubs | 141 |
| Weakly linked markdown | 20 |
| **wire** | 263 |
| **merge** | 0 |
| **quarantine** | 34 |
| **legacy** | 273 |

## Merge candidates (explicit)

| ID | Primary | Duplicate | Note |
|----|---------|-----------|------|
| dashboard-dual-home | src/pages/CommandDashboard.jsx | removed: src/pages/Dashboard.jsx | Former assistant page duplicate removed; ED Copilot now lives in src/components/CopilotPanel.tsx (ChatInterface.tsx superseded it and was itself removed as dead code, 2026-07-17). |
| pack-marketplace-dual | src/pages/organization/OrganizationPages.jsx (PackMarketplace) | /asset-packs vs /settings/organization/packs | Intentional dual context: product discovery and organization entitlement management share PackMarketplace. |
| notification-services-dual | src/services/NotificationService.ts | src/test/fixtures/legacyNotificationService.ts | Legacy queue-style client moved to test fixtures; active app client is src/services/NotificationService.ts. |

## Critical findings

1. **Simulation / lab / 3D workspace styles** — `SimulationLaboratoryViewer.css` is an intentional shared style module for active demo pages; no missing page component is required. Class: **legacy**.
2. **AI agents / platform APIs** — platform/product clients are represented in `frontendApiCallsInventory`; current scan has no **wire** findings.
3. **Chart/export components** — legacy barrel-only components have been removed; keep new chart surfaces route-owned. Class: **resolved**.
4. **Dual registry** — hundreds of tools in inventory without dedicated page components (route-only). Class: **legacy** (inventory-first) unless promoting to assets.
