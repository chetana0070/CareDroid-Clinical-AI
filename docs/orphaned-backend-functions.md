# Orphaned backend functions

Every backend HTTP route is either **wired** to a frontend client or listed below with an exposure strategy. Gated frontend calls (no Nest route) are tracked in section D.

## A. Backend-only (correct)

| Route | Controller | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| `/api/auth/verify-email` | AuthController | Email link callback |
| `/api/auth/google` | AuthController | OAuth redirect |
| `/api/auth/google/callback` | AuthController | OAuth callback |
| `/api/auth/linkedin` | AuthController | OAuth redirect |
| `/api/auth/linkedin/callback` | AuthController | OAuth callback |
| `/api/two-factor/verify` | TwoFactorController | Used during login challenge |
| `/api/subscriptions/webhook` | SubscriptionsController | Stripe webhook |
| `/api/v1/governance/registry` | AIGovernanceV1Controller | Compatibility alias; SPA uses canonical CareDroid governance route |
| `/api/v1/governance/safety-rules` | AIGovernanceV1Controller | Compatibility alias; SPA uses canonical CareDroid governance route |
| `/api/v1/governance/compliance` | AIGovernanceV1Controller | Compatibility alias; SPA uses canonical CareDroid governance route |
| `/api/v1/governance/violations` | AIGovernanceV1Controller | Compatibility alias; SPA uses canonical CareDroid governance route |
| `/api/v1/governance/validate-prompts` | AIGovernanceV1Controller | Compatibility alias; SPA uses canonical CareDroid governance route |
| `/api/interoperability/events` | InteroperabilityController | Integration Hub ingestion endpoint for authenticated adapters and backend workflows |
| `/api/cost-optimizer/route` | CostOptimizerController | Assistant lifecycle invokes route optimization server-side before model/tool execution |
| `/api/health` | AnalyticsController | Client health ping (distinct from GET /health) |
| `/api/ai/query` | AiController | Invoked via chat pipeline |
| `/api/ai/structured` | AiController | Invoked via chat pipeline |
| `/api/metrics` | MetricsController | Prometheus scrape |

### Internal services (no HTTP)

| Symbol | Module | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `RagService` | `modules/rag` | Chat retrieval |
| `EncryptionService` | `modules/encryption` | At-rest crypto |
| `CacheService` | `modules/cache` | Redis layer |
| `EmailService` | `modules/email` | Transactional mail |
| `EmergencyEscalationService` | `emergency-escalation` | Chat pipeline |
| `IntentClassifierService` | `intent-classifier` | Via POST /api/chat/* |
| `ToolOrchestratorService.executeInChat` | `tool-orchestrator` | ChatService internal |
| `FHIRService / MPIService / OCRService / TextMiningService` | `services + api/smart-intake.routes` | Mounted only by the optional Mongoose CareDroid smart-intake workflow |
| `LiveTrackingService legacy adapters` | `modules/live-tracking` | Legacy source-compatibility adapters; active routes live on FleetController, HospitalMapController, and TelemetryController |
| `EdgeAIAmbulanceService` | `services + api/ems.socket` | CareDroid WebSocket support registered from backend startup |

## B. Expose through SPA (recommended)

| Route | Controller | Client hint |
|-------|------------|-------------|

## F. Exposure strategy summary

| Tier | Action |
|------|--------|
| P0 | Keep capability gates on phantom frontend paths until Nest implements or UI removed |
| P1 | Keep `clinicalToolsApi` coverage for validate, catalog/executors, statistics |
| P1 | Keep `complianceApi` coverage for consent, export, and delete-account |
| P2 | Keep protocol/drug GET clients covered in the reference inventory |
| P3 | Chat suggest-action / analyze-vitals on dashboard |

## Quick counts

| Category | Count |
|----------|------:|
| Backend HTTP routes (total inventory) | 586 |
| Wired frontend → backend | 307 |
| Backend-only / deferred (policy) | 280 |
| Gated frontend (no route) | 36 |
| POST executors | 39 |

_Cross-check: total inventory (586) should equal wired (307) + backend-only (280) + any remaining unlisted routes. See [backend-exposure-report.md](./backend-exposure-report.md) for the authoritative scan._
