# Product Packaging Audit

Generated: 2026-07-23 (regenerate with `npm run product-packaging-audit:write-docs`)

## Productization model

CareDroid productization uses four packaging dimensions for every **seeded platform asset**:

| Dimension | Canonical source | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Solution pack** | `asset_packs` / `SEED_ASSET_PACKS` | Sellable entitlement bundle (install per org) |
| **Specialty pack** | `specialty_catalog` / `SEED_SPECIALTIES` | Specialty marketplace and discovery filters |
| **Role pack** | `role_profiles` + pack `targetRoles` | Role profile preferred assets and pack role targeting |
| **Organization type** | `asset_packs.organizationTypes` | Which tenant segments may install the pack |

Commercial **products** (`product-catalog`) map 1:1 to solution pack ids for the nine hospital suites below.

## Executive summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|------:|
| Seeded platform assets | 69 |
| Fully packaged (all four dimensions) | 68 |
| Packaging violations (seeded assets) | 1 |
| Missing specialty mapping | 1 |
| Missing role mapping | 0 |
| User-facing registry tools frontend-mounted | 291 |
| Frontend-mounted registry tools awaiting backend seed rows | 245 |
| User-facing registry tools without mounted asset projection | 0 |
| Nine solution packs present in seed | 9/9 |

### Strategy verdict

**PARTIAL:** 1 seeded asset(s) fail one or more packaging dimensions — see violations below.

**Backend seed backlog:** 245 user-facing tools are covered by the frontend mounted asset projection but are not yet direct backend `platform_assets` seed rows.
**Projection coverage:** All user-facing registry tools have mounted asset projection coverage.

## Nine solution packs (generated catalog)

| Marketing name | Pack ID | Product slug | Assets in pack | Linked in product |
|---------------|---------|--------------|---------------:|-------------------|
| Emergency Department Pack | `emergency-department-pack` | `emergency-department-suite` | 19 | Yes |
| ICU Pack | `icu-pack` | `icu-suite` | 6 | Yes |
| Cardiology Pack | `cardiology-pack` | `cardiology-suite` | 4 | Yes |
| Laboratory Pack | `laboratory-intelligence` | `laboratory-suite` | 5 | Yes |
| Medical IoT Pack | `medical-iot-pack` | `medical-iot-suite` | 4 | Yes |
| Digital Twin Pack | `digital-twin-pack` | `digital-twin-suite` | 4 | Yes |
| Simulation Pack | `simulation-training-pack` | `simulation-training-suite` | 3 | Yes |
| Governance Pack | `governance-compliance-pack` | `governance-compliance-suite` | 4 | Yes |
| Research Pack | `research-education` | `research-suite` | 5 | Yes |

Supporting packs (also seeded): `core-platform`, `emergency-medicine`, `hospital-operations`, `fleet-logistics`, `ai-workflow-pack`.

## Canonical sources (recommended)

| Concern | Canonical | Consumers |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Solution pack definitions | `backend/.../platform-asset-seed.data.ts` → `SEED_ASSET_PACKS` | DB seed, entitlements, marketplace |
| Platform asset rows | `SEED_PLATFORM_ASSETS` (derived from packs) | `platform_assets` table |
| Sellable products | `backend/.../product-catalog-seed.data.ts` → `SEED_PRODUCTS` | `/api/products`, commercial UI |
| Specialty packs | `SEED_SPECIALTIES` | `/api/specialties`, specialty pages |
| Role packs | `SEED_ROLE_PROFILES` + pack `targetRoles` | `/api/platform/me/role-profile`, recommendations |
| Org-type defaults | `DEFAULT_PACKS_BY_ORGANIZATION_TYPE` | Org onboarding, default entitlements |
| SPA tool launch (pre-asset) | `src/data/toolInventory.js` | Routes, calculators, sidebar |

## Packaging violations (seeded assets)

| Asset ID | Solution packs | Specialty | Role | Org types | Violations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| analytics | reception-desk, trackmind | — | registration-clerk; administrator; pack:reception-desk→registration clerk; pack:reception-desk→receptionist; pack:reception-desk→front desk; pack:trackmind→steward; pack:trackmind→racetrack admin; pack:trackmind→operations manager | hospital, clinic, ems, long_term_care, telehealth, health_system, racetrack | missing-specialty-pack |

### Missing specialty pack

- `analytics` — packs: reception-desk, trackmind

## Remediation playbook

1. **Solution pack** — Add asset id to appropriate `SEED_ASSET_PACKS[].assetIds` (or `core-platform` for universal tools).
2. **Specialty pack** — Add asset id to `SEED_SPECIALTIES[].assetIds` for each relevant specialty slug.
3. **Role pack** — Add to `SEED_ROLE_PROFILES[].preferredAssetIds` and/or pack `targetRoles` for role targeting.
4. **Organization type** — Ensure at least one containing pack lists the tenant segment in `organizationTypes`.
5. **Backend seed backlog** — Promote high-value mounted projection rows into backend `platform_assets` seed rows when they need entitlement enforcement, billing, or marketplace ownership.
